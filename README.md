# CSCE-5063-Machine-Learning-
The assignments/projects in this course are uploaded here.  
Assignment 1 (HW1.pdf): In this problem, linear regression is implemented to predict the death rate from several
features, including annual precipitation, temperature, population, income, pollution, etc.
Assignment 2 (HW2.pdf): SVM is implemented on a dataset about person doesn't have diabetes (negative class) or has
diabetes (positive class), where the data is from National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive
and Kidney Diseases.
Assignment 3 (HW3.pdf): In this problem, a neural network is implemented to recognize handwritten digits. The
goal is to implement the forward propagation algorithm for prediction, and also to implement
the backpropagation algorithm for learning the weights.
